s3: as static website hosting
------------------------------
we can host the static websites in s3, since static websites does not require any cpu/memory to run the applications so we can run in s3

we can upload the files in s3 all the files css and html files

should not create folder and not to uplaod inside the folder in s3
-------------------------------------------------------------------
i faced this issue 
i created the folder and inside that i uploaded the all css,html files
and i enabled the public access to the folder, and 
enabled static web site hosting and in that 
we are giving "Index document" as index.html and can also give error.html if we get any error while accessing the files we will get error page displayed

steps to host static web site hosting:
---------------------------------------
1.upload all the files into s3
2.enable acl(this option will be visble when public access is off)
3.select all files and "in action drop-down" make (make public using ACL)
4.enable static web site hosting(in that define index.html and error.html(optinal))
5.will get endpoint from static website hosting and we can use that endpoint to access the web site


her comes one probem:
-----------------------
the end point which we got is not https(443) which means not secure 
and if you can make it secure by giving the acm certificates to that url
if we have users from world wide the response might be slow inorder to overcome that we can use "cloud front" it make http to https and whenever you create a distibution in cloud front it copies the entires files to edge locations(150+ edge locations) so that whenever request comes it will go to the nearest edge location so that leads to quick respone compare to earlier approch

cloud-front --- distribution(s3 bucket)---copies code to edge locations-----endpoint(https port:443)

we can even block-list the countries in cloud front



S3:(Global Service)
-------------------
But while creating ec2 we need to select region
we can restrict user at bucket level by givin bucket-policy
in s3 if we put logs/store data we cannot serach, it does'nt do indexing so we cant
search
cloud watch is also a storage Service it does indexing and allows to search
